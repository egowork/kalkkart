Vi har ogs√• begrenset oss til observasjoner etter 2000, og med presisjon bedre enn 100 meter. For arter som er skilleart p√• samme trinn for flere hovedtyper s√• har vi lagt til dette som tilleggsinfo direkte p√• punktlaget, ellers s√• m√• man se til den assosierte tabellen for √• se an til hvilken hovedtypen den er skille for.
